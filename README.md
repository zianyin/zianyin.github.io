# Zian Yin's Zone

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/zianyin/zianyin.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

My name is Zian Yin, and I am a master student at Dresden University of Technology, Germany. I am working with Dipl.-Ing. Lutz Morawietz, Dipl.-Ing. Martin Ufert on the field of Second-Life-Battery from electric vehicles, where I focus on the simulation of battery ageing behavior in stationary system. 

This website is a complete introduction platform for my own studying and projects presentation. Here you will find some interesting things like the structure designing project, exoskeleton roboter, etc.

Whenever you want to connect me, please move to my [Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/zian) and send me message. I'm looking forward to hearing from you :)
