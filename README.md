# Zian Yin's Zone

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/zianyin/zianyin.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

My name is Zian Yin, and I am a master student at Dresden University of Technology, Germany. I am working with Prof. Dr.-Ing. Bäker, Dipl.-Ing. Morawietz on the field of Second-Life-Battery from electric vehicles, where I focus on the simulation of ageing maneuvers in the stationary system. 

This website is a complete introduction platform for my own studying and projects presentation.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
